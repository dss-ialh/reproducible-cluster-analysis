# Sandbox
- [kmean-replica][kmeans-replica] - an applied commentary on the [K-Means Cluster Analysis][kmeans-guide-boehme] guide by [Bradley Boehmke][boehmke]. Taking advantage of Bradley's excellent coverage of the theory, we focus on syntactic and operational features of the scripted workflow involved in a typical application of this statistical technique in data analysis.
